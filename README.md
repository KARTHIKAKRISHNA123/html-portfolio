# html-portfolio
This repository features my first HTML portfolio website, showcasing two projects: Tourist Spot Ranking in Tamil Nadu, highlighting my favourite tourist spots, and Birthday Invite, a creative invitation page for my birthday. These projects mark the start of my web development journey, with plans for more advanced capstone projects in the future.
